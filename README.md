Assignment Consists of total 6 questions with some questions having sub parts too. I have created functions for every question/sub-questions in the jupyter notebook.

### Function Name



**Q1): is_fibonacci(number)**

    Question :  Write a function using only list filter lambda that can tell whether a number is a Fibonacci number or not.
    You can use a pre-calculated list/dict to store fib numbers till 10000
    

**Q2.1): add_iter(a,b)**

    Question :  add 2 iterables a and b such that a is even and b is odd
     

**Q2.2): strip_vowel(text)**

    Question :  strips every vowel from a string provided (tsai>>t s)
     

**Q2.3): as_relu(arr)**

    Question :  acts like a ReLU function for a 1D array
     

**Q2.4): as_sigmoid(arr)**

    Question :  acts like a Sigmoid function for a 1D array
 

**Q2.5): shift_by_five(text)**

    Question :  takes a small character string and shifts all characters by 5 (handle boundary conditions) tsai>>yxfn
    
**Q3): check_not_swear(text)**

    Question :  A list comprehension expression that takes a ~200 word paragraph, and checks whether it has any of the
    swear words.
    
**Q4.1): only_even(numbers)**

    Question :  Using reduce function add only even numbers in a list
   
**Q4.2): biggest_printable_ascii(text)**

    Question :  Using reduce function find the biggest character in a string (printable ascii characters)

**Q4.3): add_third(numbers)**

    Question :  Using reduce function adds every 3rd number in a list
     

**Q5): generate_number_plates()**

    Question :  Using randint, random.choice and list comprehensions, write an expression that generates 15 random
    KADDAADDDD number plates, where KA is fixed, D stands for a digit, and A stands for Capital alphabets.
    10<<DD<<99 & 1000<<DDDD<<9999
     

**Q6): generate_number_plates_dl(numbers)**

    Question :  Write the above again from scratch where KA can be changed to DL, and 1000/9999 ranges can be provided.
